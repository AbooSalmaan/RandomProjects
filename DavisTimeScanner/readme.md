###Description:
My highschool computer science teacher wanted me to create a way to wait for user input and continue if data was not entered in a certain amount of time.

The main meat behind this is based off [this article](http://www.javaspecialists.eu/archive/Issue153.html).

###Usage:
The 'demo.java' file provides a demonstration of how to use it.
